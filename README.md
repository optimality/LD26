Tower Defense Rewind
====================

Task List
---------
* Waves of enemies
* Sound Effects / Music
* Low Score List


Gameplay
--------

The player starts with a "complete" tower defense system.  They start with the toughest wave of enemies and face successively weaker waves.  The only action the player can take is to remove their own towers.  They get points each wave for the number of towers they have.  The goal is to get the *lowest* score without losing.

Art
---

Extremely minimalist art - primary colors, black and white.  Basic geometric shapes - squares for walls, circles for towers, triangles for enemies, lines for projectiles.

Themes
------
The theme of LD26 is "minimalism."  Wikipedia says minimalism is an art movement whose goal is to "expose the essence or identify of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms, features, or concepts" and that a major part of it is "repetition and iteration."

Repetition is incorporated into the game through the wave structure and successive levels.

The essential parts of a tower defense game are mobs and their path(s) through the space, and towers and their distribution.  The only necessary player action is building towers in regular tower defense, so removing them is the only necessary one in Rewind.

Similarly, one of the most basic kinds of games is the risk/reward tradeoff.  This game exposes that mechanic in one of the barest ways possible.

The player is, of course, also trying to strip their defenses down the minimum necessary - to expose the essence of their defense without redundant parts.
